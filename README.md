Exploring how to do linear regression using R and using linear regression to predict revenue 
This project shows how simple linear regression can be used to model the relationship between revenue and temperature.
I used 70% of the data as the training set and 30% as the test set.
If you own an ice cream business and you would like to a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature (degC),this model does just that 
Comparing the predicted values and the actual value by running the accuracy code, ie calculating RMSE, the RMSE= 24.9619.
The RMSE is on th elower side implying that the predictive values are closer to the actual values hence showing that the model's predictions are more accurate
